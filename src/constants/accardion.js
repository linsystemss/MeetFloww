        children: <p>Taking notes during video conferences or phone calls can be tedious and time-consuming, often resulting in non-existent or inaccurate notes.

You can fully focus on your expertise and your interlocutor, leaving Leexi to handle the rest. Whether you are in Recruitment, Sales, Customer Support, or Consulting, Leexi is made for you.
